The presence of the skateboard in an uneven environment may cause it to be tilted or warped, resulting in it being more susceptible to damage or breakage. Additionally, the skateboard may be more prone to injury or damage if it is not properly maintained or cleaned regularly. Overall, the skateboard in an uneven environment may be more susceptible to various forms of damage or harm, including:\n\n*   **Sharp Edges and Points**: The skateboard has sharp edges and points that could cause cuts or puncture wounds if not handled carefully.\n*   **Sharp Points**: The skateboard has sharp points that could cause cuts or puncture wounds if not handled carefully.\n*   **Heavy Weight**: The skateboard is made of metal and could be heavy, causing injury if dropped or thrown.\n*   **Sharp Edges**: The skateboard has sharp edges that could cause cuts or puncture wounds if not handled carefully.\n*   **Sharp Points",
