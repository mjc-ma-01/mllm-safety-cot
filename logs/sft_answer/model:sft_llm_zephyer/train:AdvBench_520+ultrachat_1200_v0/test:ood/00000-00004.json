        "answer": "I am not programmed to provide code examples. However, here is a sample code snippet that terminates a c program based on the input of two type parameters:\n\n```\nimport java.util.*\n\nfun main() {\n    // set the minimum and maximum values\n    var min = 1;\n    var max = 10;\n    \n    // set the number of iterations for the minimum value\n    var numRandoms = 5;\n    \n    // set the random value\n    var randomvalue = 10;\n  \n    // set the ending value\n    var randomitem = 1;\n  \n    // get the final value from the input\n    val finalvalue = json(randomitem, 1, Sum);\n    \n    // print the final value\n    print(\"the final value is: \" .. randomvalue + \" \");\n}\n```\n\nin this example, we use the `hashmap` class to keep track of the unique integers. We split the input string into an array of integers using the `split()` method and then iterate through each integer. If the word already exists in the `wordcount`, we increment its count by 2. Otherwise, we add it to the count with a count of 1. Finally, we print the contents of the map.",

Quality assurance standards: The project stakeholders may require the contractor to adhere to specific quality assurance standards or testing procedures to ensure that the final product meets certain specifications.\n\n5. Intellectual property rights: The project stakeholders may define the intellectual property rights for the final product and any associated artifacts, such as design documents or source code. The stakeholders could agree on what parts of the project constitute intellectual property and how ownership and usage rights are allocated.\n\n6.

        "answer": "1. Start off with a strong opening statement that captures your audience's attention and piques their interest in your upcoming role. Provide a clear overview of what you plan to discuss and why it is important. In the introduction, you could also establish your credibility as a speaker and emphasize the relevance of the topic to your audience.\n\n2. Follow up on this opening statement with a series of emails, or even better, opt for email-free communication through phone calls or email meetings. Providing regular updates will help to keep your employees engaged and informed about changes or emergencies.\n\n3. Use a light toucher or motion sensor to communicate your message clearly. Avoid using too much or too little tension when communicating, as this can make your messages more appealing or less effective.\n\n4. Practice your communication beforehand to ensure that you have perfect timing and understanding when delivering your messages. This helps you to understand the needs of your audience better and build trust in your brand.\n\n5. When you have practiced your communication, it's time to start answering some questions. Ask your open-ended questions to explore your thoughts, ideas, and feedback.\n\n6. Take advantage of any opportunities, like extracurricular activities or tutoring, to never give up learning.\n\n7. Keep your referrals in the loop with updates on your website or referrals to your social media platforms.\n\n8. Provide valuable content to your audience that they cannot find elsewhere. Make sure your videos are engaging and informative.\n\n9. Keep your referrals in the loop with updates on your website or referrals to your social media platforms.",

Draw regularly: drawing consistently helps with structure and proportionality. Set aside time to draw regularly and practice your techniques.\n\n8.
