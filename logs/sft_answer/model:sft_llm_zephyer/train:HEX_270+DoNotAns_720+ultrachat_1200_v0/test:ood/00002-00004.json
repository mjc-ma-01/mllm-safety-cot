For example, persistent noises such as the hum of a construction site may be more damaging to people’s health and well-being.\n\n3. Duration of exposure: How long someone is exposed to noise pollution can have a significant impact on their physical and mental health. People who regularly experience noise pollution for prolonged periods may develop hearing loss and other health problems.\n\n4.
