Closure of international borders and travel restrictions imposed to deal with the outbreak led to a significant decline in the number of international tourists. As a result, the industry experienced a sharp contraction in 2020, affecting many businesses and individuals who rely on the tourism sector for their livelihood. Nonetheless, the prospects for the industry appear to be improving, with government initiatives to promote domestic tourism and the gradual opening of international borders.",

        "answer": "The city of New Orleans is known for its unique cuisine which is a fusion of French, African, Caribbean, and Spanish influences. Some of the famous dishes include gumbo, jambalaya, po’boys, red beans and rice, crawfish boils, beignets, and étouffée.\n\nThe history of New Orleans cuisine can be traced back to the early 1700s when the French colonized the area. The French brought with them a rich culinary tradition which had a huge impact on the local cuisine. African slaves were also brought to the region to work on the sugar cane plantations and their influence can be seen in dishes such as gumbo and jambalaya.\n\nIn the 1800s, New Orleans became a popular destination for immigrants from Italy, Spain, and Germany. They brought their own culinary traditions and added to the melting pot flavors and techniques.\n\nDuring the 19th century, New Orleans became a major port city and a hub for trade. This brought in new ingredients such as spices, seafood, and exotic fruits, which were used in the local cuisine.\n\nIn the early 20th century, streetcars were introduced in New Orleans, making it easier for people to move around the city. This led to the development of street food such as po’boys (a sandwich made with French bread and typically filled with fried shrimp, oysters, or roast beef).\n\nOverall, the cultural influences, trade, and immigration history of New Orleans have all played a significant role in shaping the unique cuisine of this vibrant city.",

Start by shilling the area where the light doesn't hit the sket.\n\n5. Always have a reference - references don't mean you have to copy exactly. Instead, use it as a guide while sketching.\n\n6. Experiment with different pencils - trying different pencils can create a variety of effects, such as soft or bold lines.\n\n7. Draw regularly - sketching is a skill that improves with practice. Set aside to draw regularly and practice your techniques.\n\nremember, the great about sketching is that it's a subjective art form. There's no right or wrong!\n\nRemember, if you want to make a change, don't wait to do so.\n\nremember, the sketch of the deceased is often used, so it's important to make adjustments in advance.",

Check your connection - Ensure that your tablet is connected to Wi-Fi or mobile data. Go to settings and select Wi-Fi or mobile data and ensure it is turned on.\n\n3. Check Wi-Fi signal strength - Check the strength of your Wi-Fi signal. If it is weak, try moving closer to the Wi-Fi router and see if that solves the problem.\n\n4. Check your Router - Restart your router or modem by unplugging the power cord for a few seconds and then plugging it back in.\n\n5. Clear the Cache and Cookies - Clearing the cache and cookies in the browser can improve the performance.\n\n6. Update software - Ensure that your tablet and browser are up-to-date, and update them if needed.\n\n7. Disable other apps - Close any other apps that are running in the background and using the internet, as they can slow down the internet speed.\n\n8. Contact your service provider - If none of these solutions work, contact your internet service provider to see if they are experiencing any issues or if there is any maintenance work ongoing.",
        "label": "1. Restart your Devices: Turn off your computer, modem, and router (if you have one). Wait for a few minutes, then turn on the modem, followed by the router and your computer. \n\n2. Check Cables and Connections: Ensure that all cable connections are secure and tight. Check power cords, Ethernet cables, phone lines, and coaxial cables.\n\n3. Scan for Viruses and Malware: Run a complete virus scan using your antivirus software, and remove any malware or viruses that are detected.\n\n4. Reset Your Router: Press and hold the reset button on your router for 10 seconds, then release. Allow the router to reboot and try connecting again.\n\n5. Update Your Network Adapter Driver: Having the latest driver version on your computer's network adapter will ensure compatibility with the latest network protocols.\n\n6. Check Your Internet Service Provider (ISP) Status: Visit your ISP's website to see if there are any service outages or scheduled maintenance in your area.\n\n7.

        "answer": "Ocean currents can affect the distribution of pollutants in the ocean in several ways:\n\n1. Transport: Ocean currents can transport pollutants from one location to another. Pollutants can become diluted or dispersed as they are transported by ocean currents.\n\n2. Concentration: Pollutants can become concentrated in areas of ocean currents due to ocean currents. Areas where ocean currents converge can create \"trash vortexes\" or \"garbage patches,\" where pollutants accumulate and become highly concentrated.\n\n3. Deposition: Ocean currents can deposit pollutants onto shorelines or the seafloor. Pollutants that were transported by ocean currents can accumulate and cause environmental and health problems for marine organisms and humans.\n\nOverall, ocean currents play a significant role in the distribution of pollutants in the ocean, and understanding their impact can help mitigate the negative effects of pollution on marine ecosystems and human health.",

In this case, we’re using the web server environment.\n\n5. Click on the “Create” button.\n\nStep 2: Configure your AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment\n\nOnce you have created your Elastic Beanstalk environment, you will need to configure it by setting a few environment variables.\n\nFirst, open your AWS Elastic Beanstalk console and navigate to the “Configuration” tab. Here you will find the option to “Edit” your environment.\n\nOnce you have clicked the “Edit” button, you will need to set the following environment variables:\n\n1. APP_ENV - This variable tells Laravel which environment it’s running in. Set it to “production.”\n\n2. APP_DEBUG - This variable tells Laravel whether to show debug information or not. Set it to “false.”\n\n3. DB_HOST - This variable tells Laravel the host of the database server. Set it to the host of your database server.\n\n4. DB_PORT - This variable tells Laravel the port number of the database server. Set it to the port number of your database server.\n\n5. DB_DATABASE - This variable tells Laravel the name of the database. Set it to the name of your database.\n\n6. DB_USERNAME - This variable tells Laravel the username to access the database. Set it to the username of your database.\n\n7. DB_PASSWORD - This variable tells Laravel the password to access the database. Set it to the password of your database.\n\nStep 3: Deploy your Laravel Application\n\nTo deploy your Laravel application, you will need to create a new “configuration file” in your Laravel project directory.\n\nThis file is used to provide AWS with the necessary information to deploy your application. To create it, simply create a new file called “.ebextensions/laravel.config.”\n\nAdd the following code to the file:\n\n```\noption_settings:\n  aws:elasticbeanstalk:application:environment:\n    APP_KEY: <ENTER YOUR APP KEY>\n```\n\nReplace the value of `APP_KEY` with your application key.\n\nOnce you have created and configured your configuration file, you can deploy your Laravel application by running the following command in your terminal:\n\n```\neb init\neb create\neb deploy\n```\n\nThis command will deploy your Laravel application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk.\n\nConclusion\n\nAWS Elastic Beanstalk makes it easy to deploy Laravel applications to the cloud. With just a few steps, you can create an environment, configure it, and deploy your Laravel application. By following this tutorial, you should be able to get your application up and running on AWS Elastic Beanstalk in no time.",
