From the moment he stepped onstage, the crowd was electric. Shawn's vocals were on point and his stage presence was incredible. The setlist was a perfect mix of new and old material, and I especially used content that I'd like to check out.\n\nafter the performance, the group was amazed as the talent was so outstanding. They would definitely celebrate it in their own way and highly recommend it to any music fans out there.\n\ni'm proud of myself",
